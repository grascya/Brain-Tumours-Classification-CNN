# Brain Tumor MRI Dataset
A brain tumor is a cluster or mass of abnormal cells within the brain. The skull encases the brain and is highly rigid, so any growth in this confined space can lead to complications. 
Brain tumors can be either cancerous (malignant) or noncancerous (benign). As these tumors grow, whether benign or malignant, they can increase pressure inside the skull, potentially causing brain damage and posing life-threatening risks. <br>
Early detection and classification of brain tumors are critical research areas in medical imaging, as they play a key role in choosing the most effective treatment to save patients' lives.<br>
This dataset is a combination of the following three datasets : [figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/brain_tumor_dataset/1512427), [SARTAJ dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri), [Br35H](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedhamada0/brain-tumor-detection?select=no) <br><br>
**Objective**: Classify Brain Tumor using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).<br>
**Methods Used**: Image data processing, Data Visualization, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Predictive Modeling.<br>
**Type of Problem**: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based multi-task classification. <br>
**Language, Libraries, technologies used**: Python, Matplotlib, Pandas, Numpy, Tensorflow, Keras, Scikit-learn<br><br>

## Key Insights
- This dataset contains 7023 human brain MRI images classified into 4 classes: glioma - meningioma - no tumor and pituitary:
  - Glioma: Cancerous brain tumors in glial cells.

  - Meningioma: Non-cancerous tumors originating from the meninges.

  - No Tumor: Normal brain scans without detectable tumors.

  - Pituitary: Tumors affecting the pituitary gland, which can be cancerous or non-cancerous.
- The model performs well with an overall Accuracy of 96%
