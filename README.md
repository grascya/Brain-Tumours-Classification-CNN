# Brain Tumor MRI Dataset
A brain tumor is a cluster or mass of abnormal cells within the brain. The skull, which encases the brain, is highly rigid, so any growth in this confined space can lead to complications. 
Brain tumors can be either cancerous (malignant) or noncancerous (benign). As these tumors grow, whether benign or malignant, they can increase pressure inside the skull, potentially causing brain damage and posing life-threatening risks. <br>
Early detection and classification of brain tumors are critical areas of research in medical imaging, as they play a key role in choosing the most effective treatment to save patients' lives.<br>
This dataset is a combination of the following three datasets : [figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/brain_tumor_dataset/1512427), [SARTAJ dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri), [Br35H](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedhamada0/brain-tumor-detection?select=no)
